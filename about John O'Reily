<h1>Early life</h1>



<p>When I was younger I often found myself mesmerized by the elegence of cars
    ,classic,mundane,flashy it didnt matter what mattered to me was the look of
     the car ,the specifications even at that early age I knew what I wanted to see
      in cars.All the car shows
    I attended when I was younger helped develop my expert taste in car</p>

<br>
<h2>My taste in cars</h2>

<p>My taste in cars is very universial, I often dont look at the price of a car
    but instead look at the quality of the car,I once heard a qoute from
     a car manufacturer in japan 
     and he said "All cars need to be made with love or else quality suffers and
      the car will lack soul",these words have stuck with me since 
      and this forms my taste in cars</p>

<br>
<h3>My first car</h3>

<p>My first car is what I would consider to be the more mundane type of car that
    you will see on this website
   ,the good ol Ford fiesta.The Ford fiesta is not the mightiest car in the world
    but it was on the cheaper side I remember its top speed its torque
    ,the tyre grip rating all of these stuck out to me</p>


 <br>
 <h4>Why I made this website</h4> 

 <p>i made this website because I felt there was a significant gap
     in the online car scene with too many websites
     dedicated to supercras and not enough cars for the average joe </p>
 

 <br>

 <h5>What you will find on this website</h5>
 
 <p>On this website you will find my lifes work,you will find a gallery of
    cars some normal and some not
    so normal,but never the less they all match my taste in cars and I hope they
     will match your tastes aswell
    , because thats what this websites for.</p>
